# ClearBlade IoT Core migration tool

Go tool that migrates devices from source ClearBlade device table to a destination ClearBlade device table.

## Prerequisites

This tool is designed to migrate devices between ClearBlade instances. If you havenâ€™t configured your source and destination instances yet, refer to the following documents:

## Usage

This tool allows multiple CLI flags for starting the migration. See the below chart for available start options as well as their defaults.

| Name | CLI flag | Default | Required |
| ---- | -------- | ------- | -------- |
| Path to **Destination** ClearBlade Service Account File ([see here for more info](https://clearblade.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/IC/pages/2240675843/Add+service+accounts+to+a+project))          | `cbServiceAccount`  | N/A                   | `Yes`  |
| **Destination** ClearBlade Registry Name                | `cbRegistryName`     | N/A                   | `Yes`  |
| **Destination** ClearBlade Registry Region              | `cbRegistryRegion`   | `<cbSourceRegion>` | `No`   |
| **Source** ClearBlade Registry Name           | `cbSourceRegistryName`    | N/A                   | `Yes`  |
| **Source** ClearBlade Registry Region         | `cbSourceRegion`  | N/A                   | `Yes`  |
| Path to **Source** ClearBlade Service Account File           | `cbSourceServiceAccount`  | N/A                   | `Yes`  |
| Device to migrate CSV file path         | `devicesCsv`         | N/A                   | `No`   |
| Update public keys for existing devices | `updatePublicKeys`   | `true`                | `No`   |
| Store Config Version History            | `configHistory`      | `false`               | `No`   |
| Skip Migrating Latest Config            | `skipConfig`         | `false`               | `No`   |
| Non-Interactive (silent) Mode           | `silentMode`         | `false`               | `No`   |
| Cleanup existing CB registry            | `cleanupCbRegistry`  | `false`               | `No`   |

## Setup

---

### Running the tool

Create a service account by following [this guide](https://clearblade.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/IC/pages/2240675843/Add+service+accounts+to+a+project).

Install & run the latest binary from https://github.com/ClearBlade/clearblade-iot-core-migration/releases.

`clearblade-iot-core-migration -cbServiceAccount <JSON_FILE_PATH> -cbRegistryName <CB_IOT_CORE_REGISTRY> -cbRegistryRegion <CB_PROJECT_REGION> -cbSourceServiceAccount <JSON_FILE_PATH> -cbSourceRegistryName <SOURCE_CB_IOT_CORE_REGISTRY> -cbSourceRegion <SOURCE_CB_PROJECT_REGION>`

You will be prompted to enter a device's CSV file path that will be used to migrate devices specified in the CSV file. You can skip this step by pressing enter; by default, all the registry's devices will be migrated. Alternatively, you can set the `--silentMode` flag to run the tool in non-interactive mode.

**Note: if providing a CSV file, the file must have column headers defined in row 1. In addition, the column specifying device IDs must have a column header of deviceId**

**Note: We recommend you use Linux or Darwin binaries. It's unlikely, but something could fail during the migration. A failed_devices CSV file will be created at the end of this migration. Please submit this file to [ClearBlade Support](https://clearblade.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portal/1/group/1/create/20), and we will ensure 100% success.**

**Running this tool close to your ClearBlade instances (e.g., same cloud region) will improve migration speed.**

**When migrating gateways, the tool checks that bound devices exist, creates those devices if they don't exist, and binds them to the gateways.**

**Rerunning the tool against previously migrated devices and gateways will update them, if needed, and skip them if not. This includes updating gateway to device associations (bindings).**

### Migration tool compilation

The tool was written in Go and therefore requires Go to be installed (https://golang.org/doc/install). To compile the tool for execution, the following steps need to be performed:

1.  Retrieve the migration tool source code.
    - `git clone git@github.com:ClearBlade/clearblade-iot-core-migration.git`
2.  Navigate to the _clearblade-iot-core-migration_ directory.
    - `cd clearblade-iot-core-migration`
3.  Compile the tool for your needed architecture and OS.
    - `GOARCH=arm GOARM=5 GOOS=linux go build`

### Release a new version

To release a new version, the following steps need to be performed:

1.  Commit and push your changes to the master branch.
2.  Add a new tag to the new commit.
    - `git tag -m "Release v1.0.0" v1.0.0 <commit_id>`
3.  Push tags.
    - `git push --tags`
4.  GoReleaser and GitHub actions will take care of releasing new binaries.
